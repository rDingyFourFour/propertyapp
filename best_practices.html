          <h3>House Best-Practices</h3>
          <p>To protect your comfort, safety, and enjoyment, and that of your neighbors, the owner recommends the following guidelines
          concerning your conduct while a tenant of the premises. In accordance with Section 11 of your Lease.

          <h4 class="header_hbp">Noise and Behavior</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Tenant shall not make or permit any noise, or engage in or permit any other conduct that disturbs or offends other
            residents or neighbors. Special consideration must be exercised before 8a and after 10p. Tenant must comply with
            the directions of the Owner and Owner’s determination shall be final.</li>
            <li>Tenant is responsible for ensuring that disturbing noises are not caused by Tenant’s family, guests or invitees. Social
            gatherings of Tenant and their guests are welcomed and encouraged provided that such gatherings do not become loud,
            boisterous, or generally objectionable, as judged in Owner’s sole discretion, so as not to interfere with the right of
            quiet enjoyment of other residents and neighbors.</li>
            <li>Radios, televisions, or other sound equipment should NEVER be operated to the disturbance of others. Special care should
            be exercised before 8a and after 10p. Tenants must comply with the directions of Owner and Owner’s determination
            shall be final.</li>
            <li>Consumption of alcoholic beverages, by Tenant or Tenant’s guests is prohibited in the common areas of the Building.</li>
            <li>Residents are expected to cooperate with each other in resolution of any potential disputes, and are encouraged to use
            the services of a local dispute resolution service if they are having difficulty at dispute resolution on their own.
            Tenant recognizes and agrees that it is unfair and impractical to demand that Owner take sides between them or use
            Owner’s authority against one resident for the benefit of another. Therefore, tenant agrees that under no circumstance
            will Owner be required to take any sort of action whatsoever as between Tenant and other residents or guests to resolve
            disputes, nor shall Owner be required to take any sort of action whatsoever as between Tenant and other residents or
            guests to resolve disputes, nor shall Owner be required to evict, or threaten to evict, any resident because of a
            dispute upon demand by Tenant, and Owner’s failure to do so shall not give rise to a claim against Owner for breach of
            Tenant’s quiet enjoyment or any other causes of action.</li>  
          </ol>
